# ðŸš— Car MPG Prediction App

This project is a regression-based machine learning app that predicts the **Miles Per Gallon (MPG)** of a car using its technical specifications. The app is built using **Streamlit** for interactive input and runs a pretrained model (`auto.pkl`) in the backend.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To estimate a carâ€™s fuel efficiency (MPG) based on attributes such as engine specs, weight, and model year. This can assist car manufacturers and buyers in evaluating performance.

## ðŸ§  Model Details

- **Model:** Pretrained regression model (e.g., RandomForestRegressor or similar)
- **Target:** `MPG` (Miles Per Gallon)
- **Input Features:**
  - Cylinders
  - Displacement
  - Horsepower
  - Weight
  - Acceleration
  - Model Year
  - Origin (1: USA, 2: Europe, 3: Asia)

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Streamlit** â€“ Web app UI
- **Joblib** â€“ Model loading
- **NumPy, Pandas** â€“ Data handling

## ðŸš€ Features

- Simple UI to input car details
- Real-time prediction of fuel efficiency
- Error handling and data validation
